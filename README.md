#  Mental Health Chatbot

Hey there! Welcome to, a friendly mental health chatbot we built for our M.Tech SNLP mini-project at PES University. Our goal was to create a safe and private space to help you check in with yourself. It's all about boosting your emotional well-being with some helpful chats, self-check-ins, and calming exercises!

---

##  What can you do here?

-   **Chat Anonymously:** Have a supportive chat whenever you need it! We used some cool NLP (with NLTK) to help the bot understand what you're saying.
-   **Keep a Private Journal:** Jot down your thoughts and feelings in your own secure journal. It's a great way to get to know yourself better.
-   **Relax with Mindfulness:** Feeling stressed? Check out our collection of positive quotes and simple breathing exercises to help you find your calm.
-   **Quick Self-Check-ins:** Curious about how you're doing? Take our simple self-tests (based on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) to reflect on your mood.
-   **SOS Hotline:** If you need help right away, we've got a list of emergency contacts you can call.
-   **Your Privacy Matters:** We take your privacy seriously. Everything you do here is just for you, and your password is super secure.
